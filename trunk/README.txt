This code repository is the ongoing work of an open source mobile application called Art in the City.  Several Omeka (omeka.org) plugins are included in the Omeka folder, and Phonegap (phonegap.com) code is in the Phonegap folder.

Our goal has been to create the prototype of an open source, cross-platform application that interfaces with an Omeka archive and can easily be reproduced by other institutions.  Parts of the code are currently abstracted for use by everyone, while other parts of the code remain specific to the needs of our project.  All code is released under GPL v3.

If you're interested in the development of the project, drop Dave a line or say hi to the crew in the Omeka IRC channel, #omeka on irc.freenode.net
